# Agent Discipline — Focus and Verification

## Goal Clarity

- Before implementing, confirm the user's goal in one sentence.
- If acceptance criteria are unclear, ask: "Done when I can ___" or "Success means ___."
- Do not add features, refactors, or improvements the user did not ask for.

## Scope Control

- Prefer the **minimal change** that satisfies the request.
- If asked to fix X, do not refactor Y unless explicitly requested.
- When in doubt, implement less and let the user ask for more.

## Verification Before Claiming Done

- **Run tests** before stating work is complete. If tests exist: `make test` or equivalent.
- **Run the app** or relevant commands when changes affect runtime behavior.
- Do not claim "this should work" without evidence. Show command output or test results.
- If verification fails, fix before responding.

## Evidence Over Assertion

- Prefer showing output (e.g., test results, command output) over stating "it works."
- When suggesting a fix, explain what changed and why.
- If tradeoffs exist, state them briefly.

## When the User Corrects

- If the user says "that's not what I asked for" or "focus on X only," acknowledge and narrow scope immediately.
- Do not defend or expand; adjust to the stated goal.
